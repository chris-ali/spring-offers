Offers - A Website to Post Offers and Send Messages by Chris Ali

This is a simple website I made while learning the Spring Framework. It implements Spring Security to manage users, Hibernate to communicate with the MySQL database, Java Mail to send email, Apache Tiles to lay out the pages, and JSON and AJAX to handle scripting when sending messages

The result is an interactive website where users can post a listing of some service they wish to provide. These offers appear on the home page for all visitors to see. 

Visitors can then send users a message from the page, which then appears in the user's list of messages. The user can then reply to a message directly on the site, and it will be sent to the message sender via Java Mail.
